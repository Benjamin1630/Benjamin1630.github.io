				Welcome,

				I have put a lot of time, effort and creativity into this website, so please
				be considerate when giving me feedback.
				<br>
				Now, for the real stuff.
				<br>
				For the sake of creativity, I created "Touch Digital". A small group of people
				that enjoy playing Games, much like me. <br> They also make Videos for
				their Youtube channel and take Pictures with their New Camera.
