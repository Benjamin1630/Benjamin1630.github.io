		<h1>Wanna know the History of this website and how it started?</h1>
		<h2>We always had a growing passion for html, Web-Design and User Interface.</h2>
		<p>We put a lot of effort into the general experience of this Website to make it as <a href="alternative.jpg">easy</a> and as <a href="alternative.jpg">fun</a> as possible.</p>
		<p>
			It all started when we went to school and learnt a bunch of html code. Our love for it only began.
			As we grew older we fell victim to the seducing colour palettes used on many other Websites.
			We quickly realized that the alluring User Interfaces made the whole experience a pleasure.
			It became clear that we needed to make out own to hopefully bring that same pleasure to others.
			We studied Websites, Games and Applications to find dirty little secrets hidden in plain sight.
			As every exciting find became a lust and greed for knowledge, we lost ourselves in the depths of 
			coding, stacking information on top of each other without a care in the world if it worked.
			We didn't enjoy this. "If we make something, it needs to work!" We told ourselves. It was clear to 
			us at this point that we needed to starte again from the ground up. So we clutched our keyboard and
			wrote some code baby.
