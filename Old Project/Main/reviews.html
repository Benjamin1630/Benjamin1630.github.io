						Minecraft is a game nearly everyone has heard of by now. You are dropped
						right into a World once you start and a goal or mission is never given
						to the player. This is makes learning the mechanics of the game feel
						much more rewarding and keeps the player dedicated. It is infamous for
						it's player-base being children, due to it's simple block style, making
						it easy for kids to learn. However, this game has so much more hidden
						in plain sight. With tons of items to craft and recipies to brew, this
						game has hours of endless enjoyment.

						This game takes its player to a stunning world with breathtaking views.
						Don't let this fool you, as enemies are quick to overwhelm and attack you.
						The game gives the player a brief tutorial on the combat system which
						is extremely satisfying, as the player feels every punch and kick.
						Overall, this game recieves a 8.5 thanks to its beautiful scenery and brilliant combat.

						This Ubisoft title is unlike any other game Ubisoft has produced in
						recent years. Siege has a large impact on the player, from strategically
						selecting operators for certain situations and map layouts to using
						technology such as drones to plan out your assault. Siege currently
						has over 20 operators as of now, all of which have their own unique
						abilities that they can bring to the table.

						This instant hit brings an old-timey world into modern technology.
						From the second it starts it makes the player feel as if we they in this dense
						world and never, not even for one second, does anything seem unreal.
						The graphics are stunning! This game keeps the player involved even with it's
						side missions which don't lack in quality. Rockstar has outdone themselves with this one!

						This early access title is surprisingly polished with new enemies
						and weapons always revealing themselves to the player along their playthrough.
						The further down you go, the tougher it gets. This is apparent
						immediately with "Tiers". The higher the tier, the stronger it is.
						Levels remain exciting to play as different biomes and enemies keep
						the player busy and don't feel repetitive, since each level is procedurally
						generated to some degree.
						<br><br>
						**WARNING** Developers have abandoned this game. It's a shame.
