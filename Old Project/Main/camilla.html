			<h2>Dear Camilla,</h2>
      <p>
        You have been there for me through thick and thin, even when things are hard for yourself.
        <br>
        I always find myself thinking of you smiling when life gets hard. It helps.
        <br>
        I never really told you how much you really mean to me.
        <br>
        I've always regretted not telling you.
        <br>
        You're always in the back of my mind.
        <br>
        Someone as nice as you, deserves the best.
      </p>
      <br>
      <!--
	<h2>Here is something I wrote for you ages ago.</h2>
      <p>
        No matter how alone you feel, you'll always have me.
        <br>
        I'll always be there for you, even when you don't have yourself.
        <br>
        You're my light,
        <br>
        You're my soul.
        <br>
        You're the embodiment of my reality.
        <br>
        Please, stay with me.
      </p>
      <br><br><br>

			<h2>Please read this</h2>
	<p>
	Look, i know things have been a bit weird between us lately and I 
	dont know if this will help at all but I want to try to make things better anyway.
	<br><br>
	You are my best friend and you are the only person who genuinely cares about me. With you around I feel happier, 
	like everything is made of smiles and warmth. I dont want to ever lose such an amazing friend like yourself.
	What I wanted to say was that after that morning, I was scared to lose you and that left me sad and worried.
	As a result, I fear that I might've said some stuff out of panic. But talking to you has cleared my mind 
	and made me realize that in reality, I dont need a relationship with you to be happy like I was.
	<br><br>
	I hope that as friends we can grow stronger and experience our lives to the fullest, because I don't 
	want to be scared of losing you like that ever again.
