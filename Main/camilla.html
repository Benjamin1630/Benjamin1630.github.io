			<h2>Dear Camilla,</h2>
      <p>
        You have been there for me through thick and thin, even when things are hard for yourself.
        <br>
        I always find myself thinking of you smiling when life gets hard. It helps.
        <br>
        I never really told you how much you really mean to me.
        <br>
        I've always regretted not telling you.
        <br>
        You're always in the back of my mind.
        <br>
        Someone as nice as you, deserves the best.
      </p>
      <br>
			<!--
      <h2>Here is something I wrote for you ages ago.</h2>
      <p>
        No matter how alone you feel, you'll always have me.
        <br>
        I'll always be there for you, even when you don't have yourself.
        <br>
        You're my light,
        <br>
        You're my soul.
        <br>
        You're the embodiment of my reality.
        <br>
        Please, stay with me.
      </p>

        No, it won't be love at first sight when we meet,
        <br>
        it'll be love at first rememberence 'cause I've recognized you in my father's eyes when he tells me,
        <br>
        <i>
          marry the type of woman you'd want to raise your daughter to be like.

        Only One.
        <br>
        Whether you are kind or mean. Quiet or Loud. Gentle or Forceful.
        It only takes one person to make a difference in someone's world.
        <br>
        This World has many negatives, but when I look at you, all I see are the positives. <br>
        I can't truly express in words just how I feel when you are around. <br>
        You have no idea how much you mean to me, so just know; <br>
        I love you and I feel like you are my only one.
