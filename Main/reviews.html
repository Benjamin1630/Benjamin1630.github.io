					This Ubisoft Title is unlike any other game by Ubisoft and rightfully
					so, has much more of an impact on the Player. From the Explosions in walls
					to the Strategical thinking, no two games are ever the same. You can pick
					from over 20 different operators, each with their own unique Weapons
					and Abilities.

					This instant Hit brings an old-timey world into modern technology.
					From the second it starts it makes the player feel as if we they in this dense
					world and never, not even for one second, does anything seem unreal.
					The Graphics are Stunning! This Game keeps the player involved even with it's
					side missions which don't lack in Quality.
					Rockstar has outdone themselves with this one!

							This early access Title is surprisingly polished with new enemies
							and weapons always revealing themselves to the player along their playthrough.
							The further down you go, the tougher it gets. This is apparent
							immediately with "Tiers". The higher the tier, the stronger it is.
							Levels remain exciting to play as different biomes and levels keep
							the player busy and don't feel repetitive, since each level is procedurally
							generated to some degree.
							<br><br>
							**WARNING** Developers have abandoned this Game. It's a shame.
