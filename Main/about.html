			<h1>A little History about this Website.</h1>
			<div class="about-text">
				<p>
					This Website has gone through many iterations within the past few Months. It started development on the 1st of October 2018 and has been Improved ever since.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>The very first development looked like this:</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="photo">
				<a href="../Old/Data/Original/OldHomepageNoLink.html" target="_blank">
					<img src="first_website.png" alt="First Website" width="1058">
				</a>
				<p>This is the Look we were going for at the very start of this Project.</p>
				<p class="btw">(You can click on the Image to go there and explore Everything!)</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="about-text">
				<p>
					There was nothing on the website yet and none of the navigaion buttons worked.
					<br>
					It was a complete wasteland.
					<br><br>
					The Website went under heavy development for a couple of weeks and it started to take shape.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>This is after a couple of weeks:</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="photo">
				<a href="../Old/Data/Light/Homepage.html" target="_blank">
					<img src="second_website.png" alt="Second Website" width="1058">
				</a>
				<p>As you can see it looked a lot better than the First Design.</p>
				<p class="btw">(You can click on the Image to go there and explore Everything!)</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="about-text">
				<p>
					A few more Navigation Links were added and Pages were filled with Text now. However, we found it difficult to choose our style for the
					Website and experimented with a lot of different styles.
					<br>
					If you want to see the full update log, you can do so on the <a href="../Old/Data/Light/News.html" target="_blank">News page</a>.
					<br><br>
					After v1.6 on the 5th of November nothing happened anymore, we had included every Idea we had. There was nothing we could add.
					<br><br>
					On the 23rd of November, we decided to restart the entire Project, except this time, it would be for real, so we started from the ground up
					and created what you see now completely from scratch and uploaded the entire thing onto a Server! Our dreams were complete, the Website was
					streamlined with optimization right from the start, we even found a proper colour palette for our Site.
